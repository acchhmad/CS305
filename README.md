# CS305

Client and Software Overview

The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a company that provides financial services and handles sensitive customer data. The company wanted to improve the security of its software application. The main goal was to find security vulnerabilities and make sure the software protected data safely during storage and transmission.

What I Did Well and Why Secure Coding Matters

I did a good job identifying security risks in the application by reviewing the code and using security tools to scan for vulnerabilities. Secure coding is important because security flaws can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and loss of customer trust. Strong software security helps protect user data, keeps systems reliable, and supports a company’s long-term success.

Challenges in the Vulnerability Assessment

One challenging part of the assessment was reviewing dependency-check results and deciding which issues were real threats and which were false positives. This was also helpful because it taught me how to carefully analyze security reports instead of relying only on automated tools.

Improving Security and Future Methods

I improved security by using better encryption practices, managing dependencies more carefully, and following secure coding standards. In the future, I would continue using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, code reviews, and security testing to identify risks and choose the best ways to fix them.

Testing for Security and Functionality

After making changes to the code, I rebuilt and ran the application to make sure it still worked correctly. I also rechecked the application for vulnerabilities to confirm that no new security issues were added during refactoring.

Tools and Practices Used

I used tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, Maven, Java security libraries, and secure coding guidelines from Iron-Clad Java. These tools and practices will be useful in future coursework and real-world software development.

What I Would Show Employers

For future employers, I would show the completed Artemis Financial security report included in this repository. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze software security risks, apply secure coding practices, and document my work clearly.
